    frequency[item] = 1
    ~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^
IndexError: list assignment index out of range

Process finished with exit code 1


Understanding :

In this we have taken "frequency" as an empty list, so when we were going to do

frequency[item] += 1

let say for first element in my_list

frequency[1] += 1

It will throw error, because the "frequency" list is empty and we want to modify at 1st index place , which is not present, so the error is "IndexError: list assignment index out of range"


Solution:

If we take frequency as empty dictionary then frequency[1] will treat 1 as key and whatever assignment you will do , will be considered as its value and if this key is not present it will create the key.
